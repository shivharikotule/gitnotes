<h2> Topic Git Merge Conflict</h2>
<h3> git merge conflict arise when there is diffrent data on same lines/location
	this feature was unable because when you are merging something on remote branch there 
	might be chance that your local repo data might be gone so what to keep is what you need 
	to figure out by choosing in that file , also git is used for file isolation according to the branch so 
there will not be a conflict 
another thing is that when you clone the repo the default branch that get created is main branch but when you initialise the repo at that 
	time the branch that is getting created is master so while adding remote you need top chage the branch master to maia
